#+TITLE: Algebrae in Scala
#+AUTHOR: Ross A. Baker
#+DATE:	<2019-12-02 Mon>

Delivered at the December, 2019 meetup of IndyScala.

* Abstract

Scala developers like to talk about "algebras". Or when they're
feeling particularly precious, "algebrae." Ross gives an overview, and
promises any references to "F-algebra" are not a taunt about your
ninth grade report card.
